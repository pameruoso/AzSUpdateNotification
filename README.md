# Azure Stack Hub Update Notification

The purpose of this project is to monitor the status of the updates for Azure Stack Hub.

Azure stack hub updates and hotfixes are very long in terms of installation time and babysitting the adminportal is not that funny.

This is why I decided to create a simple bot on telegram and a script that can send messages to a Telegram channel with the update status.

At the moment the project is based on telegram due to free apis available, but potentially it can be adapted with Twilio, Whatsapp Business and Teams.
